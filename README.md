The Portfolio Optimisation Project Using Mean Variance Method 
Using Mean-Variance optimisation together with stock data from Yahoo Finance, the mean-variance process was applied using 2020-2021 data. Ideally, the timeframe for the calculations would be longer (2 or more years), however, the idea was to explore the impact of Covid-19 on these specific stocks.
